<h1>NAME</h1>

<p>svsh - Process supervision shell for Perp/S6/Runit</p>

<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p><code>svsh</code> is a command line shell for process supervision suites of the <a href="http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html">daemontools</a> family. Currently, it supports
<a href="http://b0llix.net/perp/">perp</a>, <a href="http://www.skarnet.org/software/s6/index.html">s6</a>
and <a href="http://smarden.org/runit/">runit</a> (yes, ironically <code>daemontools</code> is not supported
yet). It provides a unified interface allowing easy inspection and manipulation of services
(i.e. processes) managed by supported supervision suites.</p>

<p><code>scsh</code> does not require any configurations or changes to your suite's service directories;
just point it at a base directory and you immediately get a usable shell, listing all
services and their statuses, and accepting commands to perform on them.</p>

<p>The shell provides a very simple syntax that is easy to remember, far simpler than the
particular syntax of the underlying tools provided by the supervision suite itself. Instead
of having to execute <code>perpctl -b /services q nginx</code> to restart an nginx service running from
<code>/services/nginx</code>, just execute <code>restart nginx</code>. Couldn't be simpler.</p>
